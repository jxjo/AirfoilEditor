Show some of the functionality of the 'Worker' 
to automate typical tasks in airfoil design   

- repanel and normlize an airfoil 
- set flap
- check the geometric quality of an airfoil 
- set geometry like thickness or camber 
- set trailing edge gap 
- generate polars in xfoil format - ready to import into Xflr5 

Some of the functions need input data from an input file (here 'worker.inp')
 
Run the example by: 

-> run_worker
